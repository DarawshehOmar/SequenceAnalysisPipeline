# SequenceAnalysisPipeline

SequenceAnalysisPipeline is a Python-based tool designed for fetching, saving, aligning, and analyzing nucleotide sequences from NCBI. The tool includes functionalities for constructing phylogenetic trees based on the fetched and aligned sequences.

## Features

- Fetch nucleotide sequences from NCBI using Entrez.
- Save fetched sequences to a file.
- Perform sequence alignment using Clustal Omega.
- Construct and visualize phylogenetic trees.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Biopython
- Tkinter

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DarawshehOmar/SequenceAnalysisPipeline.git
    cd SequenceAnalysisPipeline
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install biopython
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python project1.py
    ```

2. Enter your email and query to fetch sequences from NCBI.
3. Save the fetched sequences if needed.
